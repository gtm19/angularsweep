`angularsweep` contains functions which implement the angular sweep
algorithm in order to determine the circle with specified radius which
contains the maximum number of a provided set of points in two
dimensional space.

It can also do the same with a weighting variable: giving the circle
with the weighted maximum number of points within it. This could be
used, for example, to identify the circle containing the largest
aggregate value of a number of buildings, given their values.

## Installation

You can install the released version of angularsweep from GitHub with
the following command:

``` r
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/gtm19/angularsweep")
```
