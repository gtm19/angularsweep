Description: `angularsweep` contains functions which implement the angular sweep algorithm in order
    to determine the circle with specified radius which contains the maximum number of a provided set of
    points in two dimensional space. It can also do the same with a weighting variable: giving the circle
    with the weighted maximum number of points within it. This could be used, for example, to identify the 
    circle containing the largest aggregate value of a number of buildings, given their values.
